# cache_hierarchy
A two-level direct-mapped cache implemented in Vivado. The CPU module issues read, write, trigger, and reset requests to the cache hierarchy. The L1 cache contains eight blocks of 32 bytes each with addresses partitioned into an 8-bit tag, a 3-bit index, and a 5-bit byte offset. On an L1 hit, the index and offset select the target word in the block RAM interface, and the dirty bit is set whenever the operation is a write. On an L1 miss, if the dirty bit is clear the requested block is fetched directly from the L2 cache. If the dirty bit is set, the old block is first written back to L2 before fetching the new block. Once the miss is resolved, the original read or write completes at L1. The L1 controller interfaces with a Vivado block RAM while the L2 cache controller manages a pre-initialized memory array.
